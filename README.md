# 🎬 AI Content Filter Demo

This project is an early prototype of an **AI-powered content filter** for streaming platforms (e.g., Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime).  
The main goal is to automatically detect and blur or skip **violent/bloody scenes**, making watching safer for younger or sensitive audiences.  

---

## 🚀 Project Vision
- Build an AI model that detects violent scenes in video streams.  
- Apply filters (blur, skip, mute) automatically in real-time.  
- Create a user-friendly interface where viewers can customize filtering levels.  

---

## 📌 Current Roadmap
- [ ] Research violence-detection models available on **Hugging Face** and **RunwayML**.  
- [ ] Build a simple prototype using **OpenCV** (blur function for detected frames).  
- [ ] Train/test with sample video clips to measure accuracy.  
- [ ] Design mockups (UI/UX) for how this could look in a streaming app.  
- [ ] Prepare a pitch deck for investors and streaming platforms.
